        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, and pepper 
                in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls; flatten to make thin patties.
                Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each of four of the patties. Top each of 
                the patties with cheese with one of the patties without; press the edges together 
                to seal the cheese into the center.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of 
                doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer 
                inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
            </li>    
        </ol>
