        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Roasting enhances the flavors of any vegetable, but seems to add a wonderful, rich 
            sweetness when done with cherry tomatoes. This recipe takes that sweetness, 
            complements it with fresh herbs and a touch of heat from red pepper flakes, with some 
            low-fat ricotta to smooth it all out. I topped it with some salty, nutty Pecorino
            cheese.

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup julienned fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped flat-leafparsley</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano </li>
            <li>12 ounces whole wheat linguine</li>
            <li>1/2 (16 ounce) container low-fat ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely shredded Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine all tomatoes, garlic, chicken broth, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper 
                in a large, glass baking dish; toss to coat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roast in the middle of the preheated oven, stirring regularly, until tomatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. 
                Remove from the oven and stir in basil, parsley, and oregano.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the tomatoes have been roasting for about 35 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a 
                boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes (cook for 2 minutes less than 
                package directions.) Drain and return to the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the roasted tomatoes and herbs to the linguine and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Add ricotta 
                cheese and stir until melted and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve topped with Pecorino Romano cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>
